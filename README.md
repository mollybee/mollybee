### Hi there! Molly Brown here. ðŸ‘‹ (She/Her)

I currently reside and work in Columbus, OH, but am always open to adventure. 

ðŸŒ±At the moment, I'm working through the Web Development Track at Lambda School, building on my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, React, Node.js, and Redux, to name a few.

ðŸ‘¯I would LOVE to collaborate on any humanitarian efforts. The leading drive for my developer journey has been to come out the other end with some set of skills that I can use to make the world a better place. For the people who live on it, and for the Earth herself. 

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my Acrylic Paintings. I might have a passion for all things science, techonology and innovation, but my side love is all things art and literature. 

âš¡ Fun fact: I identify as a strong woman, a feminist, a nature-witch, and bisexual married mother of three ambitious daughters. I'm also open to ANY good book recommendations!
